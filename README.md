# Analysing Data On Dairy and Beef Exports Industries In India

This project aims to look at the linkages between the dairy and beef export industries in India. Through data, I highlight the socio-economic and political factors that influence beef exports from India. 

## Data

Multiple datasets from various data sources have been used to create the narrative for the story.

The data on beef exports from India was retrieved from the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA). It can be extracted from [here](https://agriexchange.apeda.gov.in/indexp/genReport_combined.aspx#content)

The data on milk production was from Basic Animal Husbandry Statistics 2020 and can be found [here](https://dahd.nic.in/sites/default/filess/Book%20BAHS%202020-Final.pdf)

The data on number of cattle and buffaloes in India was based on the 2019 Livestock Census and can be found [here](https://dahd.nic.in/sites/default/filess/District-wise%20cattle%20population%202019_1.pdf) and [here](https://dahd.nic.in/sites/default/filess/District-wise%20buffalo%20population%202019_1.pdf).

The land-size based data on Indian dairy farmers was from a 2019 National Statistical Office (NSO) report. The report can be found [here](http://164.100.161.63/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Report_587m.pdf)

The data on proportion of animals owned by small and marginal farmers was from the 2019-20 Annual Report of the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying. The report is [here](https://dahd.nic.in/sites/default/filess/Annual%20Report%202019-20.pdf).

CSVs of all these data files are in the data folder.

## Notebooks

I used Pandas for data cleaning and pivoting. The [Cows and Beef.ipynb](https://github.com/ramanshreya/beef-exports-and-dairy-industry-in-india/blob/main/Cows%20and%20Beef.ipynb) notebook has all details of the analysis.
